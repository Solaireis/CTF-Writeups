#Draft
will tidy up rn just dumping my experience
Strategies used
First play the function as is black box approach see what the program is abt
-got understanding the logic but dont exactly understand the question
Second Read the source code as a white box approach to understand the logic
-to see how the logic is being flowed
third find the requirement needed to obtain the flag
-to understand the win conditions needed to win
Fourth run some test cases to see how the factors change in a black box approach
-to see what happens when i do xyz
fifth find a solution to solve
-managed to achieve the first condition which is time reaching 20s

sixth
-finding a better solution to solving this problem
-searching onlines for tools and things to solve
-stumbled upon pwntools for python to connect to vm
-and bash scripting for script to input into the vm

seven 
-found pwntools python too difficult and hard to understand so didnt bothered further
-focus on making the bash scripting
-realised that bash script theres abit hard to do the execution of eveyrthing within files

-remembered that one can send the output of the scirpt througha  pipeline to the server 
-run test cases to see if the output can really get into the server output
-realised that simple test cases works, then i run conditionals to achieve the probable soln
-optimise to fix the bugs that happen in a blackbox testing
