this one is very fun
first i google the username surpringly no results

then i started searching for username website hunting tools to search
the first website i used managed to narrow my results but it wasnt enough as it gave many false negatives

i realised there ought to be betetr google search results which exists, actually i found one and it lead me to 3 websites that contains the harveyhacks

this turns out to be a crypto challenge too 
it was my first time using cyberchef so i was extremely clueless about what this website is about and i had to play around with it

i realised we need decode the aes cipher so i pullled a aes decoder,
its in cbc mode so i just put the keys and iv inside. I realised it is invalid and then i realised they shifted the cipher to have the rot13 mix everything up and
eventually i got the flag
