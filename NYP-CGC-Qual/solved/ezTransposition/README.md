used dcode to bruteforce the permutations
eventually after looking into the transposition i realised it could be a columnar transposition so i looked for an interactive columnar transposition decoder to interatively solve the challenge 
i initially thought its 5 columns instead of 6 later i realised its actually 6
then i also thought the ?? marks are pointless however i realised the flag i got without the qn marks are wrong leading me to believe they are part of the flag
